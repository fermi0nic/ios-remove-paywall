## iOS Remove Paywall Shortcut

Allows users to quickly create archived pages and bypass paywalls from Safari.

### Installation and Configuration

**Step 1:**

[Click here to install the shortcut] (Remove%20Paywall.shortcut)


> Here, you will be prompted to add the shortcut. 
> This shortcut functions entirely from within the 
> Share Menu of your preferred browser(s), so make sure
> not to try running it from within the Shortcut app!
> It won't work :)


**Step 2:** Enabling Permissions


> Next, we need to make sure the shortcut has the 
> proper access that it needs in order to run. They are:
>   1. Permission to Access the Clipboard
>   2. Permission to use the browser
>   3. Permission to access the different page archive
>      services/websites.
>      
>    For each of these, you will be given the following
>   options:
>     - "Don't Allow"
>     - "Allow Once"
>     - "Always Allow"
> 
>    For each Privacy/Permission prompt, select 
>     "Always Allow".
    
**Step 3:** Selecting the proper permissions

> For the clipboard and browser permissions, you 
>     will have to do this the very first time.
>     
>  However, you will be prompted the first time for
>  	each of the four paywall removal websites the 
>  	first time you use them, so make sure that you're
>  	paying attention and don't accidentally hit the 
>  	wrong option! Personally, I recommend just getting
>  	it over with and trying out each of the four 
>  	back to back. It's also a good opportunity to see 
>  	how each of them may differ.
 	   

    If that makes any of you nervous,
    don't be. This shortcut is really just a
    glorified copy & paste tool that copies the
    article url, pastes it into a new tab, and copies 
    the url to the archived page to your clipboard. 
    
    That's it!

**Step 4:** Running the shortcut!
